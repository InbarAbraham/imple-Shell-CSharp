# Mini Shell in C#

This is a simple shell implementation written in C# as part of an Operating Systems course.

## 🧠 Overview

The shell supports:
- Executing commands like `cd`, `dir`, etc.
- Displaying the current directory
- Exiting the shell gracefully

It demonstrates basic process and command handling in C#.

## 📁 Files

- `Program.cs` – The main program that runs the shell loop
- `Shell.cs` – Contains logic for interpreting and executing shell commands

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this project, I learned:
- How to work with user input and string parsing
- How to implement a loop-driven CLI in C#
- Basics of system interaction and process execution in .NET

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET CLI
- Visual Studio

## 📚 Course

This project was created during the Operating Systems course in my B.Sc. in Computer Science.
